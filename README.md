# Vehicle Inventory Project

This project implements a vehicle listing feature for an automotive web application based off my own design. The application displays a list of retailer's available vehicles and allows users to filter and sort these vehicles.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Core Features

- Single Page App using Vue 3 (Composition API), TypeScript, HTML and SCSS
- Mobile first design and responsive up to larger screens
- Vehicle ordering based on price, mileage or age
- Simulates API calls to mimic asynchronous behaviour and provide mock data

## Future Enhancements

- View the details of a single vehicle on a separate page
- Display a representative finance calculation on the single vehicle view page
